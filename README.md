# Compression-Algorithms

1>Arithmetic Compression Algorithm(lossless compression)
  I just explored and tested for compressing a text file contaning only a string of character a-z.
  This resulted me a 1.9 kB of file to 136 Byte of file. 
  It contains both compression and decompression back to same state. 
  Also I implemented as efficient as I can do.
  
  Suggestions invited for more efficient implementation and with greater range of coverage (example for image compression).
